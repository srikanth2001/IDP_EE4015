\subsection{Dense-Sparse stream based compression}
In this scheme, the file $X$ is divided into fixed-size chunks and each chunk is stored using two streams: dense stream $D$ and sparse stream $S$. This scheme is a modified version of [1]. \\
\textbf{Compression:} Let $C_i$ be the compressed block corresponding to the original block $B_i$, and $L_i$ be the length of $C_i$. The typicality of the block is decided using the threshold $T = b (H(X) + \epsilon)$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $C_i \leq T $, then \\~\\
         \smallskip \hspace{5ex}$
        \begin{gathered}
            D_i = C_i[0 \ldots L_i-1] \\
            S_i = 0 ^ b
        \end{gathered}
        $
    \item Else,\\~\\
        \smallskip \hspace{5ex} $
        \begin{gathered}
            D_i = C_i[0 \ldots T-1] \\
            S_i = C_i[T \ldots L_i-1]
        \end{gathered}
        $
\end{itemize}
Each of $D_i$ and $S_i$ are padded with zeroes such that the length of $D_i$ is $T$ and the length of $S_i$ is $b$. 
Finally, the sparse stream $S$ is compressed using a sparse bit-vector compressor.

The header $h$ is stored as follows-
$$
\begin{gathered}
    h_i = \sum_{j=0}^{i} L_j, \text{ for } 0 \leq i \leq N_b - 1 \\
\end{gathered}
$$

\textbf{Decompression:} To decompress the $i^{th}$ block, the LZ-compressed block $C_{i}^{'}$ needs to be constructed. The start position and the compressed size of the block is obtained from the header as follows-
$$
\begin{gathered}
    start_i = h_i \\
    size_i = h_{i+1} - h_i,  \text{ for } 0 \leq i \leq N_b - 1 \\
\end{gathered}
$$
The compressed block $C_{i}^{'}$ is constructed as follows-
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $size_i \leq T $, then \\~\\
         \smallskip \hspace{5ex}$
        \begin{gathered}
            C_i ^ {'} = D[0 \ldots size_i - 1]
        \end{gathered}
        $ 
    \item Else,\\~\\
         \smallskip \hspace{5ex}$
        \begin{gathered}
            C_i ^ {'} = D[0 \ldots T - 1] \quad || \quad S[0 \ldots size_i - T - 1]
        \end{gathered}
        $
        
        where $||$ is the concatenation operator.
\end{itemize}
The sparse stream values are accessed using the random access operator on the sparse bit-vector.
The block $C_i ^ {'}$ can now be decompressed using the Lempel-Ziv algorithm to obtain $B_i$.
